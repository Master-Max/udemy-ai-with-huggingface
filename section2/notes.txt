Libraries to work with NLP

1. NLTK
2. SpaCy
3. Tensorflow ( google )
4. PyTorch ( meta )
5. HuggingFace

Using HuggingFace

- HuggingFace is company and open-source platorm (yay)

- Provides
    > Pre-Trained AI models ( NLP, vision, aduio, ect )
    > APIs and tools to download and fine-tune
    > Model Hub with thousands of models
    > Colaborative community

- All done with the Transformers library of HuggingFace

HuggingFace Transformer Library is NOT the Transformer Architecture that makes up how Attnetion Based LLMs work

Transformers Library - Python
- Simplifies working with Transformer models
- Download pretrained model, and fine tune them
- Use models for text classification, translation, summarization, q/a, and more
